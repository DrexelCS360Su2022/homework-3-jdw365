## Problem 5: Homework statistics

Please let us know how much time you spent on each problem. You may enter time using any format described [here](https://github.com/wroberts/pytimeparse).

Problem 1:
5 minutes
This problem was very simple and did not require much thought to complete. The only thing that took a little bit more effort was implementing the "error" primative.

Problem 2:
30-40 minutes
This problem gave me a lot of issues at first, but once I sat down with the professor and worked on it during office hours I figured out how to do it. 99% of the amount of time it took to complete this problem was on the "and" function. The "or" function was just the exact identical copy/pasted code as the "and' function, but the boolean terms were all inverted (true was changed to false wherever it showed up, and false was changed to true wherever it showed up.)

Problem 3:
2-3 hours
This problem gave me an extremely difficult time to complete, but even now it is not 100% functional. It took me a very very long time to even figure out what the core requirements of making this function were, and I did not feel like the lecture slides were giving me enough information to figure it out on my own. Even after going to office hours for this problem on Tuesday, as well as getting help from the professor and other students in class on Thursday, I still only managed to get this function working to the point that if you give it exactly 1 binding such as (let ([x 5]) x), then it will return 5 properly. However, if you attempt to do something like (let ([x 5][y 4]) x) then it does not work. I have absolutely no idea how to fix this issue, and I do not have enough time to continue banging my head against a wall trying to figure it out because I still have an entire assignment for another class that is also due tonight at midnight

Problem 4:
I did not even have enough time to get around to doing this problem. There wasn't enough time in the week for me to get the help I needed during office hours. I literally went to the full extent of the professor's available office hours on Tuesday, and sat in class for almost 2 hours after the lecture ended on Thursday so that I could get help with the assignment from the professor and any students in the room who knew how to help. And even with all of that I still couldn't get enough help to complete this entire assignment. There just isn't enough time for me to get help, this assignment was extremely difficult to understand with very minimal amounts of information on how to complete it that can be gained through reading the lecture slides, and not a single other kuid in the class had actually even gotten as far as I had in the assignment so I ended up being the one helping them instead of them helping me. The fact that not a single student in the class felt comfortable enough with this assignment to laeve the class once the professor ended the lecture and said that we would devote the remaining hour of class to working on this assignment really makes me feel like this might be far above our ability to handle with the amount of resources that we were given. I don't kow if it was that the leture slides didn't have enough direct code implementations of the concepts involved, or if the assignment itself was simply too difficult, but something about this assignment was literally impossible for us to complete without staying with the professor for several hours at a time just to get even halfway through the assignment.
